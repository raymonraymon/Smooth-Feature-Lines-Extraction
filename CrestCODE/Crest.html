In this research, we develop a fast and robust method for detecting
crest lines on surfaces approximated by dense triangle meshes.
The crest lines, salient surface features defined via first- and 
second-order curvature derivatives, are widely used for shape 
matching and interrogation purposes. Their practical extraction 
is difficult because it requires good estimation of high-order
surface derivatives. Our approach to the crest line detection 
is based on estimating the curvature tensor and curvature 
derivatives via local polynomial fitting. Although in general 
local fitting methods do not lead to a high-quality estimation 
of high-order surface derivatives to compare with global ones, 
a careful choice of a discrete scheme for estimating the surface 
normal and a fitting method allows us to get very close to the 
quality of results obtained with global fitting methods. <p>

Another difficulty in practical detection of the crest lines follows 
from the fact that the crest lines are not defined in planar, 
spherical, conical, cylindrical and other surface patches where 
the focal set (caustic) degenerates. In practice, due to noise and 
mesh irregularities, a straightforward detection of the crest lines 
will result in producing many spurious crest lines in such surface 
regions. A new thresholding scheme is proposed in order to filter 
them out. The scheme exploits interesting relationships between
curvature extrema, the so-called MVS functional of Moreton and Sequin, 
and Dupin cyclides, surfaces whose focal sets degenerate to curves.

Since the crest lines are salient view- and scale-independent surface 
features which correspond well to human perception of surface creases, 
it is natural to use them for adaptive mesh simplification. 
We do it via incorporating salient crest lines and their regions 
of influence into a standard mesh decimation scheme.<p>

<H3>How to use</H3>
<ul>
<li><font color="993300">Program Organization:</font> The program is constructed by two parts: C++ and Java3D (CrestViewer.jar). The C++ program do actual computations to detect crest lines: normal estimation, polynomial fitting, curvature derivatives calculation, crest line tracing, and Thresholds computations (Ridgeness, Sphericalness and Cyclideness). The Java3D program can visualize the detected crest lines, and can produce an input file for the C++ code easily. Of cause you can use only the C++ code but you have to write the input and visualization parts by yourself. CrestCODE.tar.gz includes a directory: CCode. The CCode directory has all C++ files and Makefile.</li>
  
<li><font color="993300">Compile:</font></li>
  <ul><li><font color=blue>C++ code</font>, by using attached Makefile, you may run "make" in CCode directory. Then you will get the executable file "<i>setCurvature</i>". Please move <i>setCurvature</i> to the JViewer directory (% mv setCurvature ../JViewer/) if you would like to use the Java3D Viewer. Otherwise you can deal with the <i>setCurvature</i> file. You should use the later versions of g++ 2.95.</li>
</ul>
  <li><font color="993300">Execute:</font></li>
<ul>
  <li><font color=blue>C++ code</font>, You can run <i>setCurvature</i> itself as (% ./setCurvature input.txt output.txt). Then you will get also ridges.txt and ravines.txt which include the information about convex and concave crest lines. The output.txt includes the curvature tensor information. The formats of input.txt, output.txt, ridges.txt and ravines.txt are described in File Formats section of this simple manual.</li>
<li><font color=blue>Java3D Viewer</font>,</li> You need <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/index.jsp">JDK and Java3D API</a> environment. You may run java (% java CrestViewer.jar). It is better to specify max and initial heap sizes as (% java -mx600m -ms600m -jar CrestViewer.jar) to avoid <b>OutofMemoryError</b>. Please read the Quick Practice and Viewer Options sections to play the Java3D Viewer. <font color="red">Note that the executable file setCurvature should be located in same directory of CrestViewer Jar file.</font></li> 
</ul>
<li><font color="993300">File Formats:</font> </li>
 <ul>
   <li><font color="blue">Input for Java3D Viewer:</font> The input triangle mesh have to be constructed by the <a href="http://www/~shin/Research/PLYformat/PLYformat.html">PLY2 format</a>.
   <li>Recall, when we apply "./setCurvature input.txt output.txt" which also generates ridges.txt and ravines.txt. These .txt files are ascii text.</li>
<ul>
   <li><font color="blue">Input of C++ code (input.txt): </font> Similar format of the PLY2 format <font color ="red">but it is not an exact PLY2 format.</font> 1st line is a number of vertices. 2nd line is a number of triangles. 3rd line is a neighborhood size (Integer) for fitting.  4th line is 0 (no crest line tracing) or 1 (with crest line tracing). After these four lines, there are vertex coordinates and face information as PLY2 format but there is no 3 for face line (only three vertex IDs).</li>
   <li><font color="blue">Outputs of C++ code: </font></li>
   <ul>
     <li><font color="blue">output.txt</font>: 1st line is a number of vertices (Integer). 2nd line is a number of triangles (Integer). Starting from 3nd line, 11 Double values in one line: k_{max}, k_{min}, x,y,z of t_{max}, x,y,z of t_{min}, and x,y,z of normal for each vertex ID of input mesh. </li>
   <li><font color="blue">ridges.txt/ravines.txt: </font> 1st line is a number of convex/concave crest line points (Integer). 2nd line is a number of convex/concave crest line edges. 3rd line is a number of crest line connected components (Integer). Let us notate <i>V</i>, <i>E</i>, and <i>N</i> for above numbers, respectively. Starting from 4th line, there are <i>V</i> lines which include three Double and one Integer values in one line as "%lf %lf %lf %d": x,y,z of crest line point and the connected component ID. The line number of the file minus 4 represents a crest point ID. Next, there are <i>N</i> lines which include three Double values in one line: Ridgeness, Sphericalness and Cyclideness for each corresponded connected component ID (ex. 1st line of this section corresponds ID 0 of the connected component, 2nd line of them represents ID 1 and so on). Finally, there are <i>E</i> lines which include three Integer values: pair of crest points ID (edge) and the triangle ID of original mesh which includes this edge (if there is -1 of that triangle ID then that edge is a connecting edge, see the <a href="../../spm05ybs.pdf">paper</a>).</li>
   </ul>
   </ul>
 </ul>
 <li><font color="993300">For Windows User:</font> Please use CrestViewerWindows.jar instead of CrestViewer.jar because you may have <i>setCurvature.exe</i> instead of <i>setCurvature</i>. If you have <i>setCurvature</i> then it is OK to use CrestViewer.jar on the Windows OS. Cygwin may help to compile my code on Windows.
</ul>

<font color="red">Note that the C++ executable file (setCurvature) and the Java Jar file (CrestViewer.jar) should be in the same directory.</font>

You can dynamically visualize the curvature via selecting these checkbox in the Visualization Type Panel after select this checkbox menu.

<ul>
  <li>Smoothing: apply smoothing to the mesh. St = T,LL: bitangential Laplacian. St = L: Laplacian. St = L(L): bilaplacian. I: initialize vertex positions.

  <li><font color="blue">FRT:</font> This checkbox affects the crest line thresholding when you scroll the scrollbars. On: the scrollbar dynamically affects the visualization result. Off: the scrollbar does not affects the visualization result. It might be useful for the huge meshes because you can change a value of thresholding without visualization, then you can update that value by clicking the triangle buttons of the left and right sides of the scrollbar after activate (off -> on) this checkbox.</li>
  
  </ul>
